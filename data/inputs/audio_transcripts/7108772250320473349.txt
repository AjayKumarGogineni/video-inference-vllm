 These are 5 out-of-the-box activities for your trip to the Greek island of Paros. Number 1. Go have a meal in the traditional village of Lefkest. From Lefkest you can make a 3.5 kilometer hike on the old Byzantine road which leads to the even more traditional village of Prodromos. The hike should take about 45 minutes. Number 2. Go to the beach of Kalogero. Here as you can see you can enjoy a natural mud mask and taking some clay off the rocks. Number 3. Another beautiful secluded beach is the beach of La Guelli. Be aware of the fact that this beach attracts a lot of nudists. But since it's kind of a secret beach, there's enough space for everyone. Number 4. Go to the Paros Butterflies Nature Reserve. You can enjoy a beautiful walk through the butterfly valley. It's only 5 kilometers away from the main town of Paros and you can even go there on an organized excursion. Number five, drive by Agios Fokas. Just six kilometers away from the capital of Paros. As you can see it's unspoiled, unorganized and with an amazing picturesque church.
