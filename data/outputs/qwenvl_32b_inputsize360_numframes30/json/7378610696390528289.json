  "summary": "The video discusses the historical announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron of the dissolution of the National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale) following the victory of the Rassemblement National in the European elections. This move, authorized by Article 12 of the French Constitution, leads to new legislative elections to elect new deputies. The speaker clarifies that this dissolution does not affect the recently held European elections and explains that the first round of the legislative elections will take place on June 30th, with the second round on July 7th. The last dissolution occurred in 1997 during Jacques Chirac's presidency, resulting in a left-wing victory and a change in the Prime Minister. The video concludes by suggesting that if another political movement wins the legislative elections, there could be a change in government and Prime Minister.",
