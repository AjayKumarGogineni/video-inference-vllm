  "summary": "The speaker expresses frustration and disgust towards individuals on social media platforms who praise war criminals like Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin while criticizing Joe Biden. They argue that the justification for praising these war criminals is based on the number of people killed, which they find morally reprehensible. The speaker emphasizes that the number of casualties does not diminish the severity of war crimes committed by these leaders. They mention specific examples, including the deaths and disappearances in Gaza, the West Bank, and the conflicts involving Putin and Hussein. The speaker questions whether the criticism of Biden is due to a dehumanization of the victims of other war criminals.",
