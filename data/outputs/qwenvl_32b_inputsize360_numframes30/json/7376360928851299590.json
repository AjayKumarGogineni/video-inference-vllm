  "summary": "The video discusses the trend of using retinol in skincare products as an anti-aging component. The speaker notes a significant increase in searches for 'retinol' in Ukraine since 2021, suggesting effective marketing efforts. Retinol is described as a clinically validated ingredient for preventing signs of aging, but the speaker questions the exaggerated expectations some have regarding its capabilities. While retinol can improve skin texture, making it appear brighter and more elastic, it cannot reverse gravity-induced sagging or eliminate wrinkles. The speaker emphasizes realistic expectations, acknowledging that retinol provides benefits like improved skin radiance but does not perform dramatic anti-aging transformations.",
