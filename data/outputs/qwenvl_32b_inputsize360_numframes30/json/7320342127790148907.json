The citizen, who identifies himself as 50 years old and has never been arrested, insists on his legal right to film on federal property, citing a 2010 DHS memo that allows filming in publicly accessible areas. He argues that he is exercising his constitutional rights and is not violating any laws. The officer, identified as Sergeant Dunaway, attempts to restrict the filming, leading to a heated exchange. The citizen repeatedly emphasizes his legal standing and suggests contacting higher authorities, including the district attorney, to verify his claims. The conversation includes references to potential legal consequences for the town if his rights are violated. The citizen also mentions having a son, creating a personal connection with the officer. The overall tone is confrontational, with the citizen maintaining a calm yet assertive demeanor while the officer appears resistant to his demands.",
