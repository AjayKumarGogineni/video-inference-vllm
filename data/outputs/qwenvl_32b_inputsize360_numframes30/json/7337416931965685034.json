  "summary": "The video discusses a rural electric cooperative in eastern Oregon with one of the largest carbon footprints among the state's utilities. Emissions have significantly increased due to a major customer, Amazon, which has constructed 10 large data centers in the area. These data centers require substantial electricity for operation and cooling. Despite Amazon's stated goal of transitioning to renewable energy, the current power grid cannot meet the demand, leading to continued reliance on non-renewable sources. Amazon plans to build 10 more data centers in the region, raising questions about Oregon's approach to planning for a clean energy future.",
