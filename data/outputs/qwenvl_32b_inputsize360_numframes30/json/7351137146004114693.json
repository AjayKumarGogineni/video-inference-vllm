  "summary": "The video features a repetitive vocal performance where the word 'пирожные' (which translates to 'pies' or 'pastries' in English) is sung repeatedly throughout the duration. The lyrics consist solely of this single word, creating a monotonous yet rhythmic pattern. There are no visible visuals or imagery provided in the frames, suggesting the focus is entirely on the auditory experience. The repetition gives the impression of a minimalist or experimental musical piece, possibly intended to evoke a specific mood or emotion through sound alone.",
