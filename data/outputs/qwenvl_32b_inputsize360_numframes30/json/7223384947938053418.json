  "summary": "The video discusses the misconception surrounding nine-banded armadillos and their association with leprosy. It explains that while these armadillos can carry leprosy, the disease is highly curable and weak, thriving at temperatures around 90 degrees, which matches the armadillos' body temperature. Approximately 20% of Gulf Coast nine-banded armadillos are estimated to carry leprosy, but the risk of transmission to humans is extremely low, less than 10%. The video also mentions that these armadillos are known for digging in yards, eating insects, and frequently being hit by cars.",
