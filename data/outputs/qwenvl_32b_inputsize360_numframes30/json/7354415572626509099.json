  "summary": "The video discusses the characteristics of earthquakes occurring on the eastern side of the United States, emphasizing their ability to be felt over larger areas due to the denser and older composition of the Earth's crust in this region. It specifically references a recent earthquake with a magnitude of 4.8 near Lebanon, New Jersey, highlighting how quickly reports spread across a vast population area. Comparisons are made to California, where earthquakes of similar magnitudes are typically felt in more localized regions. The video also addresses the impact of the earthquake on the New York City area, noting the issuance of emergency alerts and the susceptibility of older buildings, particularly those constructed with unreinforced masonry. Historical context is provided, mentioning a significant earthquake in 1884 that affected New York City. The video explains the reasons behind airport ground stops, transit delays, and school evacuations, attributing them to safety inspections and the seismic vulnerability of certain infrastructure.",
