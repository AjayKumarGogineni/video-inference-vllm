The narrator explains that the vehicle requires a seven-way wiring harness and electric brakes due to the onboard electric brake controller. The trailer has a two-inch ball hitch and safety chains for towing. The body is constructed entirely of lightweight aluminum, riveted in place, giving it a boat-like appearance under the belly. The trailer includes lockable compartments with stainless steel chrome hinges, providing ample storage space. Inside, there is a GoSun power center with 1,100 watts, offering electrical outlets, USB ports, and a 12-volt power socket, which can be charged using portable solar panels. There is also a portable solar table and a GoSun cooker, which uses solar energy to cook food. The cooker is demonstrated, showing how it operates and cautioning against leaving it closed in the sun to prevent overheating. Additional features include a bracket system for mounting items and electrical conduit for wiring. The trailer also contains a small fridge and a sliding tray, enhancing its functionality.",
