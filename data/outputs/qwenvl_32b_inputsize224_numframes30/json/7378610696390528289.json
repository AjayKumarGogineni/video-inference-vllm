  "summary": "The video discusses the historical announcement made by French President Emmanuel Macron after the victory of the Rassemblement National (RN) in the European elections. Macron announced the dissolution of the National Assembly, a power granted to the President under Article 12 of the French Constitution. This dissolution ends the mandate of current deputies and necessitates new legislative elections to elect new members of the National Assembly. The first round of these elections is scheduled for June 30th, and the second round for July 7th. The last dissolution occurred in 1997 during Jacques Chirac's presidency, leading to a left-wing victory and a change in the Prime Minister. The speaker mentions that if another political movement besides Macron's wins the legislative elections, there could be a change in government and Prime Minister. The speaker promises to explain further in another video and encourages viewers to subscribe.",
