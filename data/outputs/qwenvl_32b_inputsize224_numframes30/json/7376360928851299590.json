  "summary": "The video discusses the trend of using retinol in skincare products as an anti-aging component. The speaker notes a significant increase in searches for 'retinol' in Ukraine since 2021, suggesting effective marketing efforts. Retinol is described as a clinically validated ingredient for preventing signs of aging, but the speaker questions the exaggerated expectations some people have regarding its capabilities. While retinol can improve skin texture, making it appear brighter and more elastic, it cannot reverse gravity-induced sagging or eliminate wrinkles. The speaker emphasizes that retinol helps maintain a youthful appearance by promoting cell turnover and enhancing skin elasticity, but it does not perform surgical-like effects. The video aims to manage expectations about retinol's capabilities while acknowledging its benefits.",
