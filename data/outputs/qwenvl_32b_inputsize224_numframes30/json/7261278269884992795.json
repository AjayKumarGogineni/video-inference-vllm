  "summary": "The video features a dark scene with a silhouette of a person standing in front of a large, illuminated sign that reads 'What Happened in Houston Stays in Houston.' The sign is prominently displayed against a dark background, creating a stark contrast. The person appears to be addressing the camera, possibly delivering a statement or making an announcement. The phrase suggests a theme of secrecy or discretion regarding events in Houston. There is no visible movement or action beyond the stationary figure and the static sign. The overall tone is mysterious and somewhat secretive.",
