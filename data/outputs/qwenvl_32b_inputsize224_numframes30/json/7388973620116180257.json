  "summary": "The video features a speaker addressing an audience, likely at a political event. The speech emphasizes the significant breakthrough achieved by the Rassemblement National (RN), highlighting it as the most important in their history. The speaker criticizes alliances made by Emmanuel Macron and Gabriel Attal with far-left formations, which they claim have deprived the French people of a policy of renewal that was widely supported during European elections and the first round of the recent election, where RN received nearly 34% of the votes. The speaker warns that these electoral agreements will lead France into the hands of the far-left led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. The speaker promises to be with the audience until victory, declaring that a new era has begun and nothing can stop a people who have regained hope. The speech concludes with patriotic sentiments, wishing long life to France and the Republic.",
