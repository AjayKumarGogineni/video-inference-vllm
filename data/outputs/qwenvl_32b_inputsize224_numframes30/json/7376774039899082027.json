  "summary": "The video discusses an art installation titled 'Old People's Home,' created by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu in 2007. The installation is currently on display at the 'The World As It Goes' exhibition in Paris, hosted by the Borster Commerce Pinot Collections. The artwork features 13 realistic sculptures of elderly individuals (OAPs) who resemble prominent world leaders, dictators, politicians, religious figures, and military leaders from recent history. These figures are depicted in electric wheelchairs, symbolizing their diminished power and influence as they navigate the museum space at a slow pace. The sculptures represent a commentary on the passage of time and the loss of control experienced by these once-powerful individuals.",
