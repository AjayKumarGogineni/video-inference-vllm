  "summary": "The video features a repetitive audio loop of someone saying 'Just shut up, shut up, shut up, just shut up, shut up.' This is followed by a voice-over delivering a melancholic and introspective message: 'We're trying to take it slow, but we're still losing control. And we're trying to make it work, but it still ends up the worst. And I'm crazy.' The visual content is entirely black, providing no additional context or imagery beyond the audio.",
