  "summary": "The video discusses a rural electric cooperative in eastern Oregon, specifically Umatilla Electric Cooperative, which has one of the largest carbon footprints among the state's utilities. The cooperative's emissions have significantly increased over recent years, doubling between 2018 and 2020 and again in 2021. This surge is attributed to Amazon's operations, as the company has constructed 10 large data centers near Boardman and Hermiston. These data centers require substantial electricity to power and cool the servers, contributing to the rise in emissions. Amazon aims to transition to renewable energy but faces challenges due to the current limitations of the power grid. The video mentions plans for Amazon to build 10 more data centers in the region, raising questions about Oregon's approach to planning for a cleaner energy future.",
