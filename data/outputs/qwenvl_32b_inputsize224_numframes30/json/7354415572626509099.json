  "summary": "The video discusses the effects of earthquakes on the eastern side of the United States, specifically focusing on a recent earthquake with a magnitude of 4.8 near Lebanon, New Jersey. It explains how the denser and older crust in this region allows earthquakes to be felt over a larger area and cause more widespread damage compared to areas like California. The video mentions an emergency alert sent to residents in the New York City area and highlights the vulnerability of older buildings in New York City, particularly those constructed with unreinforced masonry. It references the 2011 Virginia earthquake that affected structures in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and notes that New York City only began considering seismic factors in its building codes in the mid-1990s. The video also touches on disruptions at airports and transit systems due to inspections and evacuations, as well as school closures. Finally, it mentions that the last significant earthquake with its epicenter within New York City occurred in 1884.",
