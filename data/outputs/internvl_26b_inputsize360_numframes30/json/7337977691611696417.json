  "summary": "A woman is driving a car while talking animatedly. She appears frustrated and is expressing her emotions through gestures and speech. The background shows urban scenery with buildings and parked cars. The audio includes a voice-over saying 'Just shut up, shut up, shut up, just shut up, shut up. We're trying to take it slow, but we're still losing control. And we're trying to make it work, but it still ends up the worst. And I'm crazy.'",
