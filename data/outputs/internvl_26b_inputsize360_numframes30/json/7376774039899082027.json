The installation is part of the 'Old People's Home' exhibit by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, displayed at the Borster Commerce Pinot Collections The World As It Goes exhibition in Paris. The sculptures depict leaders who were once powerful but are now frail and dependent, moving slowly in wheelchairs. The video emphasizes the contrast between their past authority and current state.",
