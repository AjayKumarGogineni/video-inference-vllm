  "summary": "The video features a cooking tutorial in Hebrew, focusing on making a layered dessert called 'הוגה' (Hoga). The speaker guides viewers through the process step-by-step, starting with preparing a biscuit base by mixing crushed biscuits with melted butter and marshmallow cream. The mixture is then pressed into a mold lined with cling film. Next, the speaker prepares a creamy cheese filling by blending various cheeses, instant pudding mix, vanilla extract, and condensed milk. The cheese mixture is then poured over the biscuit layer. The dessert is chilled in the refrigerator to set. Afterward, the speaker removes the chilled base from the fridge, adds a layer of the prepared filling, and smooths it out. The dessert is returned to the fridge to set again. Finally, the speaker spreads a layer of lotus paste on top, which is then chilled once more. The finished dessert is presented as a beautiful and delicious layered treat, with the speaker encouraging viewers to try the recipe.",
