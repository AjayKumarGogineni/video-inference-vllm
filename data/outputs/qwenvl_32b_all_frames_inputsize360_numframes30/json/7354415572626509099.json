  "summary": "The video discusses the characteristics of earthquakes occurring on the eastern side of the United States, emphasizing their ability to be felt over larger areas due to the denser and older composition of the Earth's crust in this region. It specifically references a recent earthquake with a magnitude of 4.8 near Lebanon, New Jersey, highlighting how the ShakeMap from the USGS quickly showed reports spreading across a vast area populated by tens of millions. Comparisons are drawn to California, where similar magnitude earthquakes are typically felt in more localized regions. The video also addresses the impact of this earthquake on the New York City area, noting the issuance of emergency alerts and the susceptibility of older buildings, particularly those constructed with unreinforced masonry. Examples are given of past earthquakes, such as the 2011 Virginia earthquake, which affected structures in Brooklyn, and the 1884 earthquake centered within the five boroughs of New York City. The video explains the reasons behind airport ground stops, transit delays, and school evacuations, attributing them to the need for inspections and the seismic vulnerability of certain areas and structures.",
