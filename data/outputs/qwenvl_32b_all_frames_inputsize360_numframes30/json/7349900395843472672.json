It features a character who introduces themselves as 'the forbidden underground station Russia Today,' suggesting a subversive or alternative media perspective. The character discusses their involvement in a 'special operation in Ukraine' but humorously questions why they are not at the front lines instead of being in Germany. They mention having completed their military service in the Red Army during their time in Russia and having experience fighting in Chechnya in the 1990s. The dialogue includes references to controversial topics like military service, conflict experiences, and geopolitical tensions, presented in a light-hearted or mocking manner.",
