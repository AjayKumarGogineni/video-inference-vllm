  "summary": "The video consists of a series of black frames with no visible content or action. There are no characters, settings, or discernible events depicted. The audio transcript contains repetitive syllables '바이라라라라' followed by French lyrics that translate to phrases like 'I'll let you say it under your door, under the walls that sing, near the place where your feet pass, hidden in the holes of your front, and when you are alone for a moment.' The lack of visual content makes it impossible to analyze any political or news-related context, body language, crowd reactions, or setting.",
