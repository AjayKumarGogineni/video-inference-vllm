  "summary": "The video consists of a series of black frames with white text overlaid that reads 'POV: Your cousin gives you something to drink.' There is no visible action, characters, or background in the frames. The audio transcript contains a single exclamation, 'Shit! Y'all in there? Y'all?' indicating a sense of urgency or concern. The lack of visual content suggests that the focus is entirely on the audio and the implied scenario described by the text.",
