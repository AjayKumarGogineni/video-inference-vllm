  "summary": "The video discusses the historical announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron of the dissolution of the National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale) following the victory of the Rassemblement National in the European elections. This move, authorized by Article 12 of the French Constitution, leads to new legislative elections to elect new deputies. The video clarifies that this dissolution does not affect the recently held European elections and explains the timeline for the upcoming legislative elections, with the first round scheduled for June 30 and the second round on July 7. It also references the last dissolution in 1997 under Jacques Chirac, which resulted in a left-wing victory and a change in the Prime Minister. The speaker mentions that if another political movement wins the legislative elections, there could be a change in government and Prime Minister.",
