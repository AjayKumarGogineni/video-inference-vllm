They express a dislike for washing dishes but show evidence of doing them. Afterward, they engage in work and prepare lunch, enjoying the warmth of the sun inside the shrink-wrap, which can reach up to 80 degrees. The person spends the afternoon working and later takes Phoebe for a walk, noting that it gets dark early in the winter. Despite the early darkness, they spot some ducks before returning to the boat.",
