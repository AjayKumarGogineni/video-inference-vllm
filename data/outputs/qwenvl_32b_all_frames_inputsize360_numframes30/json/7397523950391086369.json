  "summary": "The video features a dark, minimalistic aesthetic with a focus on abstract shapes and silhouettes. The primary visual element is a green apple-like figure with eyes and a mouth, which appears to be the central character. This figure interacts with other similar shapes, suggesting a narrative or thematic exploration. The background remains consistently dark throughout, emphasizing the simplicity and starkness of the visuals. The audio consists of repetitive lyrics about driving and flying, with themes of isolation ('When you're feeling alone') and a sense of movement or escape ('I wanna fly'). The lyrics convey a mix of determination ('I'm gonna drive, gonna drive for life') and introspection ('I think the apple's rotten right to the core'), hinting at underlying emotional or existential struggles.",
