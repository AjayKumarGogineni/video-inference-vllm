  "summary": "The video discusses a small rural electric cooperative in eastern Oregon, Umatilla Electric Cooperative, which has one of the largest carbon footprints among the state's utilities. The cooperative's emissions have significantly increased over recent years, doubling between 2018 and 2020 and again in 2021. This surge is attributed to a major customer, Amazon, which has constructed 10 large data centers in the area. These data centers require substantial electricity to operate and maintain cooling systems for the machinery. Despite Amazon's stated goal of transitioning to renewable energy, the current power grid cannot meet the demand, leading to continued reliance on non-renewable sources and rising carbon emissions. Amazon plans to build 10 more data centers in the region in the near future. The video explores potential reasons behind Amazon's choice of eastern Oregon for its data centers and suggests opportunities for Oregon to improve its planning for a cleaner energy future.",
