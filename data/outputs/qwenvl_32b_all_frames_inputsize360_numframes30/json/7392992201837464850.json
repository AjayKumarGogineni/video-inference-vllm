  "summary": "The video features a full-time mother in Singapore sharing her daily routine, which includes preparing for her daughter Eve's upcoming trip to Japan. She discusses Eve's decision to get a short haircut, expressing mixed feelings about it, as it is her fourth haircut and she has been sentimental about her daughter's hair growth. The mother takes the train with Eve, who enjoys the experience, and mentions that Singaporean trains are pleasant. They stop at French American Bakery for a viral torch marshmallow hot chocolate, which is described as overly sweet and rich. Later, Valda visits for a playdate, and the mother reflects on Danish playgrounds being superior. After Valda leaves, the mother indulges in a luxurious Epsom salt bath, noting her chronic muscle pain and the need for self-care.",
