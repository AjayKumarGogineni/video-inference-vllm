  "summary": "The video discusses the reputation of nine-banded armadillos, particularly those found in the American South, and their association with carrying leprosy. It explains that leprosy is highly curable in modern times and is sensitive to extreme temperatures, thriving at around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, which matches the armadillo's average body temperature. Approximately 20% of Gulf Coast nine-banded armadillos are estimated to carry leprosy, but the risk of transmission to humans is minimal, less than 10%. The video also mentions that armadillos are known for digging in yards, eating insects, and frequently being hit by cars.",
