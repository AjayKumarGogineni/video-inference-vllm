  "summary": "The video discusses the trend of using retinol in skincare products as an anti-aging ingredient. The speaker notes a significant increase in searches for 'retinol' in Ukraine since 2021, suggesting effective marketing efforts. Retinol is described as a clinically validated anti-aging component, but the speaker clarifies that it does not prevent aging or reverse gravity-induced sagging (ptosis). Instead, retinol promotes skin renewal, making the skin appear brighter, elastic, and youthful by encouraging frequent turnover of keratinocytes. The speaker advises against unrealistic expectations, emphasizing that retinol cannot eliminate wrinkles or lift sagging skin. Those who find satisfaction with retinol-based products are encouraged to continue using them.",
