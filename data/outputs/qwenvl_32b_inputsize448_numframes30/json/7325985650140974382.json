  "summary": "The video discusses the claim that running in the rain gets you wetter than walking. Jamie and Adam from the 'MythBusters' team set out to test this theory. They conduct an experiment using artificial rainfall and tight-fitting clothes to avoid sweat interference. They measure the weight of their clothes before and after walking and running in the rain, both with and without wind. The results show that running indeed gets them wetter than walking, as indicated by the increased weight of their clothes after running.",
