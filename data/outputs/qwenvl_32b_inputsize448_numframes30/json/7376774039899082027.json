  "summary": "This video showcases an art installation titled 'Old People's Home,' created by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu in 2007. The artwork is part of the 'The World As It Goes' exhibition at the Borster Commerce Pinot Collections in Paris. The installation features 13 realistic sculptures of elderly individuals who resemble prominent world leaders, dictators, politicians, religious figures, and military leaders from recent history. These figures are depicted in electric wheelchairs, symbolizing their diminished power and influence as they navigate through the museum space. The sculptures appear withered, old, and decrepit, highlighting the passage of time and the loss of control these once-powerful individuals have experienced.",
