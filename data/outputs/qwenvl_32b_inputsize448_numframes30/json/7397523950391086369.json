  "summary": "The video features a dark, minimalistic scene with a silhouette of a person standing against a black background. The person appears to have a small, round head and is wearing a suit jacket. The audio consists of a repetitive, rhythmic chant about driving, expressing a sense of determination and perhaps a desire to escape or move forward. The lyrics include themes of change ('the apple's rotten right to the core') and a yearning for freedom ('I wanna fly'). The overall tone is intense and somewhat melancholic, with a focus on personal struggle and resilience.",
