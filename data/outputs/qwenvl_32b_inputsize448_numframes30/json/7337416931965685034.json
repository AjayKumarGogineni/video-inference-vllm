  "summary": "The video discusses a rural electric cooperative in eastern Oregon, specifically Umatilla Electric Cooperative, which has experienced a significant increase in carbon emissions due to its customer, Amazon. Amazon has constructed 10 large data centers near Boardman and Hermiston, requiring substantial electricity to operate and cool their servers. Despite Amazon's stated goal of transitioning to renewable energy, the current power grid cannot meet their demand, leading to continued reliance on non-renewable sources and rising carbon emissions. Amazon plans to build 10 more data centers in the region, raising questions about Oregon's approach to planning for a clean energy future.",
