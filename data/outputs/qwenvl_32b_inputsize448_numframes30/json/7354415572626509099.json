  "summary": "The video discusses the effects of earthquakes on the eastern side of the United States, emphasizing how they can be felt over a larger area due to the denser and older composition of the Earth's crust. It specifically mentions a 4.8 magnitude earthquake centered near Lebanon, New Jersey, which was felt across a wide area containing tens of millions of people. Comparisons are drawn to California, where earthquakes of similar magnitudes are typically felt in more localized areas. The video highlights the importance of emergency alerts in places like New York City, especially given the susceptibility of older buildings made of unreinforced masonry. It references the 2011 Virginia earthquake that caused damage to such structures in Red Hook, Brooklyn, despite being hundreds of miles away. The video also explains why New York City's airports, transit systems, and schools experienced delays and closures for inspections, noting that many structures in New York City lack seismic considerations in their design. Finally, it notes that the last significant earthquake within the five boroughs of New York City occurred in 1884, causing noticeable damage.",
