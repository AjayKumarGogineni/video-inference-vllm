The daily driver is the Ferrari Purosangue, praised for its handling and performance. The second daily is chosen between the Ferrari Roma and GTC4 Lusso, with the Roma being preferred. The supercar is the Lamborghini Centenario, described as a hypercar but labeled as a supercar due to the inclusion of a more special hypercar.
