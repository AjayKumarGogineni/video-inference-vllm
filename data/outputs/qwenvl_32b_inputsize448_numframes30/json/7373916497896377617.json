  "summary": "The video features a tutorial on making a layered dessert, specifically a Lotus Biscoff cheesecake. The speaker, who appears to have a Middle Eastern accent, guides viewers through the process step-by-step. The video begins with the preparation of a biscuit crust by mixing crushed biscuits with melted butter and marshmallow cream, pressing it into a mold, and chilling it. Next, the speaker combines various cheeses (including cream cheese) with instant pudding mix, vanilla extract, and condensed milk to create a smooth filling. This mixture is then poured over the chilled crust. The speaker adds a layer of sweetened condensed milk and returns the dessert to the refrigerator to set. Finally, the dessert is decorated with a layer of Lotus Biscoff spread, creating a visually appealing and delicious treat. The video emphasizes the ease and enjoyment of making this dessert at home.",
