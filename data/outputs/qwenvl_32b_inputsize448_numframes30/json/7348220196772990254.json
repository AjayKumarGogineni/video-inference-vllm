The speaker discusses their inability to access various websites, including Google, social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit), and news outlets (New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal). They also mention the limited availability of non-state-run TV channels and the ineffectiveness of VPNs like NordVPN in bypassing censorship.
