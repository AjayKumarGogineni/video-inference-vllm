  "summary": "The video discusses the historical announcement by French President Emmanuel Macron regarding the dissolution of the National Assembly (Assemblée Nationale) in France. This decision was made shortly after the victory of the Rassemblement National in the European elections. The dissolution is a constitutional power granted to the President under Article 12 of the French Constitution. It leads to the end of the current deputies' mandates and necessitates new legislative elections to elect new deputies. The speaker clarifies that this dissolution does not affect the recently held European elections. The new legislative elections are scheduled for the first round on June 30th and the second round on July 7th. The last dissolution occurred in 1997 during Jacques Chirac's presidency, resulting in a left-wing victory and a change in the Prime Minister. The video suggests that if another political movement wins the upcoming legislative elections, there could be a change in government and Prime Minister.",
