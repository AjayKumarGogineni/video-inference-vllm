The job involves using a vacuum to remove gas from deceased individuals, described as 'fart sucking.' Despite Scott's initial shock and hesitation, he eventually agrees to take the job due to the attractive pay rate of $50 per hour. However, towards the end, it is revealed that the entire conversation was a prank orchestrated by Jubal from Brook and Jubal in the morning, with Scott's sister Amy setting him up. The prank concludes with a lighthearted suggestion to start a business together.",
