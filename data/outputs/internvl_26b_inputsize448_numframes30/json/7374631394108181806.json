Text overlay on the video provides context about her situation, mentioning that she is packing because her spouse was brought to the USA unlawfully as a Dreamer at age 19, they got married in 2012, had a daughter in 2020, and he was denied his consulate appointment. He now lives in Mexico, and she travels down every 4-8 weeks to see him. The woman is seen moving around the room, possibly organizing items.",
